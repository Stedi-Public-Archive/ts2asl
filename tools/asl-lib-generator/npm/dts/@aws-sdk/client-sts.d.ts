                *          <p>To allow a user to assume a role in the same account, you can do either of the

                *          <ul>
                *             <li>
                *                <p>Attach a policy to the user that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code>
                *                (as long as the role's trust policy trusts the account).</p>
                *             </li>
                *             <li>
                *                <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p>
                *             </li>
                *          </ul>
                *          <p>You can do either because the role’s trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based
                *          policy. When a resource-based policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no
                *          additional identity-based policy is required. For more information about trust policies and

        *          </ul>

        *          MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to
        *          assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA
        *          authentication might look like the following example.</p>
        *          <p>

        *          <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the
        *             <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The
        *             <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device.
        *          The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device

        *          <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The

        *          <p>Before your application can call <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>, you must have
        *          an identity token from a supported identity provider and create a role that the application
        *          can assume. The role that your application assumes must trust the identity provider that is
        *          associated with the identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be specified
        *          in the role's trust policy. </p>
        *          <important>
        *             <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can result in an entry in your
        *             CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims">Subject</a> of
        *             the provided web identity token. We recommend that you avoid using any personally
        *             identifiable information (PII) in this field. For example, you could instead use a GUID

        *                <p>You cannot call any IAM operations using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services API. </p>

        *                <p>You cannot call any STS operations except <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.</p>
        *             </li>
        *          </ul>
        *          <p>You must pass an inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policy</a> to
        *          this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session
        *          policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies.
        *          The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048
        *          characters.</p>
        *          <p>Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a policy, then the
        *          resulting federated user session has no permissions. When you pass session policies, the
        *          session permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session
        *          policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a
        *          federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that
        *          are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session

        *          <p>You can use the credentials to access a resource that has a resource-based policy. If
        *          that policy specifically references the federated user session in the
        *             <code>Principal</code> element of the policy, the session has the permissions allowed by
        *          the policy. These permissions are granted in addition to the permissions granted by the

        *          and <code>department</code> are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in
